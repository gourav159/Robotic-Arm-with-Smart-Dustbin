# Robotic-Arm-with-Smart-Dustbin
Overview
“Robotic Arm with Smart Dustbin” is an innovative IoT-based project designed to promote smart waste management using automation and sensors. This system uses an Arduino Uno, an ultrasonic sensor, and a servo motor-controlled robotic arm to detect nearby objects (like a hand or trash) and automatically open the dustbin lid. The Bluetooth module (HC-05) allows for wireless control, adding flexibility and user interactivity.
